# Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pool Database Project

Example of a Migration-Based deployment that deploys to an Azure Synapse serverless SQL Pool using Azure DevOps.

It uses a YAML pipeline, which is in the AzureDevOpsTemplates folder.

In order to use it in Azure Pipelines you can either import or fork this repository into another GitHub repository or into Azure Repos.

Afterwards, you can select the YAML file in Azure Pipelines and tailor the pipeline to suit your needs.

Please note that the databases have to exist in the serverless SQL Pools for this to work..
